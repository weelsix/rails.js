# Rails - rails-js
An easy to use, indipendent, home-made javascript utility library to route your single page application.

## How to use Rails
First you simply need to install Rails with npm, as always do:
```
$ npm install rails-js --save
```
*Otherwise you can clone this repo, or also grab the raw file from the source folder*

Once done import the main rails object like this

```javascript
import railsjs from 'rails-js';
```

This object contains two classes, the first one is the rails router and the second one is the extendable one for the rails page you'll have to provide to the router.

So let's setup the router

```javascript
const rails = new railsjs.Rails();
```
```javascript
// Or you can also pass a configuration object
const config = {
	manageAnchors: true,
	managePopState: true,
	autoClearContainer: true,
	containerSelector: '#rails-page',
	baseDirectory: '/pages/',
	baseExtension: '.html'
};
const rails = new railsjs.Rails( config );
```

The configuration object accepts these properties:
- __manageAnchors__: if true, when rails is created all the clicks on available anchors outside the rails container are automatically handled by rails, for future hadles insiede the rails container additional custom code is always needed ( for exeple to prevent default link behaviour )
- __managePopstate__: if true, rails will handle the push and pop state from the history api for you. This will make your navigation between pages automated and there is going to be no need to chage the url. Change this behaviour only if you're planning to use your custom code to hadle urls and link loading
- __autoClearContainer__: if true, when the previous onLeave page promise is resolved in addition to all the operations performed by rails to load the new page, the setted container will be automatically cleaned from the child nodes.
- __containerSelector__: the css selector that indicates the root DOM node for the rails application. This can be a custo div, or the entire body. By the way is always suggested to use a custom div also in a full page rails app case.
- __baseDirectory__: the directory suffix to add to the routed file for the XHR request. For example if *baseDirectory* is set to his default '/page/' the request for the home route will be '[host]/page/home.[baseExtension]'. Always remember the '/' before and after the *baseDirectory* string
- __baseExtension__: the default file extension for the XHR request. Always remember the dot before the extension.

After all the setup you need to create a class that extends the RailsPage class. This is manly because your custom page class need to have three important properties: *namespace*, *onEnter*, *onLeave*. The first one indicates the url extensions you'll want to associate this page to, the second and the third are two functions respectivelly called after the HTML has been loaded in the container or the old page is going to be replaced. Mainly the *onLeave* callback is called when the XHR request is prepared and __must__ return a promise resolved when you have done all your stuff, this promise will tell rails when the old DOM code is ready to be replaced, no going back. So the workflow is: get your promise, start a new promise for the XHR request, then when both are resolved, remove the old DOM and append the new one, then call *onEnter*.

```javascript
class Homepage extends railsjs.RailsPage {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.namespace = 'homepage';
	}

	onEnter() {
		// Perform a simple in animation with GSAP
		TweenMax.fromTo(this.view, 0.3, {opacity: 0}, {opacity: 1});
	}

	onLeave() {
		// Return the promise, resolved at the end of the animation
		return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			TweenMax.fromTo(this.view, 0.3, {opacity: 1}, {
				opacity: 0,
				onComplete: function() {
					// ... do some other stuff
					resolve();
				}
			});
		});
	}
}
```
One you have all your pages, you simply need to call *init* on the rails instance and pass an array with all the pages you need to register. Each page is registered with his reference to his namespace.

```javascript
const homepage = new Homepage();
const about = new About();
rails.init([
	// Pages list
	homepage,
	about,
	// ...
]);
```
## Rails and RailsPage APIs

Inside the *RailsPage* you have access to the some useful properties and methods:
- __rails.go( *string* destination )__: force rails router to navigate to a destination.
- __rails.registerPath( *RailsPage* page )__: add a new page to previously registered collection. From now on this page can be used as a destination.
- __rails.handleAnchors( *HTMLElement* contex )__: add event listeners to all the *<a>* tags inside the context and bind the click to the internal rails router. Always check you context when you call this method, 'case listeners will be added not removed. *document* is the default context and this method is automatically invoched if manageAnchors is set to true inside the rails constructor.
- __RailsPage.view__: this property contains the DOM reference to the current page view root HTMLElement. Is automatically filled by rails every time the page is loaded.
- __RailsPage.namespace__: the namespace associated with the page, can be changed later on, but is not raccomanded.
